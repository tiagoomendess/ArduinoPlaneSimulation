Part one of the Real Time and Embebed Systems assessement code. This simple arduino code will simulate a very basic plane given several inputs such as throtle position, pitch, roll, altitude etc..

This simulation can be hooked up via serial port to [this](https://github.com/tiagoomendess/QtPlaneDashboard) Primary Flight Display made in Qt.
